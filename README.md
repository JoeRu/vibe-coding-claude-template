# Template for a better VIBE-Coding Experience.

Actual STATE - *work in progress*; Please add your changes as PR.

## Quick Start

Install the tooling into any existing project with a single command:

**Option A — curl (no clone needed):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoeRu/vibe-coding-claude-template/main/setup.sh | bash -s -- /path/to/your/project
```

**Option B — from a local clone:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoeRu/vibe-coding-claude-template.git
cd vibe-coding-claude-template
./setup.sh /path/to/your/project
```

**Install into the current directory:**
```bash
./setup.sh        # or: curl ... | bash
```

**Preview without making changes:**
```bash
./setup.sh /path/to/your/project --dry-run
```

The script is idempotent — re-running is safe. Existing files are backed up to `<file>.bak` before overwriting.

After installation, open your project in Claude Code and run `/init_overview`.

## End-User Documentation

### Purpose

This Project has the intend to add better results when using vibe-coding agents. The tendency is to keep lost of features, bugs, debts or security features. The XML and the Chapter for your CLAUDE.md or AGENT.md has the intend to make the use more structured.

All future .md files generated by the AI are now stored at `ai-docs` folder

### Repository Layout

All installable files live under `template/`. The installer (`setup.sh`) copies them into your target project:

```
template/
  .claude/commands/          ← slash commands for Claude Code
  .github/
    copilot-instructions.md  ← baseline Copilot instructions
    prompts/                 ← equivalent prompts for GitHub Copilot
  ai-docs/
    implementation-plan-template-v3.1.xml
  CLAUDE-implementation-plan-chapter.md
```

### Usage

Add `CLAUDE-implementation-plan-chapter.md` to your `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT.md` or `copilot-instructions.md`. The easiest way is to use `setup.sh` (see Quick Start above). To do it manually:

1. Copy the contents of `template/` into your project root.
2. Add the following lines to your agent file (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENT.md`):

```
## Implementation Plan Workflow

**IMPORTANT:** Read `CLAUDE-implementation-plan-chapter.md` for the XML-based implementation plan workflow. All feature requests, bugs, and changes must be tracked in `ai-docs/overview-features-bugs.xml`.
```

On first encounter with a codebase, perform the initial analysis with `/init_overview` and generate `ai-docs/overview.xml` and `ai-docs/overview-features-bugs.xml`.

After updating CLAUDE.md and commands you need to restart Claude Code for changes to take effect.

### Slash Commands

There are several new slash commands enabled when adding this chapter to your AI behaviour.
If you are not using Claude Code — e.g. GitHub Copilot — copy the prompts from `template/.github/prompts/` instead of `template/.claude/commands/`.

#### Item Creation

- `/bug <description>`: Create a bug item with default priority HIGH.
- `/feature <description>`: Create a feature item with default priority MEDIUM.
- `/refactor <description>`: Create a refactoring item with default priority MEDIUM.
- `/debt <description>`: Create a tech-debt item with default priority LOW.

#### Item Management

- `/approve <ID> [ID...]`: Approve items and generate branch names.
- `/implement [ID...]`: If a special ID is commited it's autoapproved, if none is commited - all Feature with APPROVED status will be implemented (max 5 in a row)
- `/deny <ID> [reason]`: Deny an item and archive it immediately.
- `/status <ID>`: Show current status, tasks, and dependencies.
- `/list [filter]`: List items by status, type, or priority.
- `/archive`: Archive eligible DONE/DENIED items and sync overview data.

#### Security

- `/security`: Run a full security audit of the codebase.
- `/security <area>`: Run a focused security audit (e.g. auth, api).
- `/security status`: Show open concerns and security coverage.

#### Plan Overview

- `/plan`: Show plan summary with next actionable items.
- `/overview`: Show architecture summary from overview.xml.
- `/init`: Run initial analysis and create both XML files.


### Features

- **Single source of truth**: Maintains active and archived work items in structured XML.
- **Clear lifecycle states**: Enforces `PENDING → APPROVED → IN_PROGRESS → DONE` or `DENIED`.
- **Consistent ID and branch rules**: Sequential IDs and standardized branch naming keep work traceable.
- **Built-in security evaluation**: Requires security impact assessment for relevant changes.
- **Complexity-aware planning**: Forces decomposition of XL items into manageable sub-items.
- **Audit-ready changelog**: Records each interaction's changes in a single entry.
- **Archival with project baseline sync**: Ensures completed work is reflected in `overview.xml`.
