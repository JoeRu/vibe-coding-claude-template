# Template for a better VIBE-Coding Experience.

Actual STATE - *work in progress*; Please add your changes as PR.

## End-User Documentation

### Purpose

This Project has the intend to add better results when using vibe-coding agents. The tendency is to keep lost of features, bugs, debts or security features. The XML and the Chapter for your CLAUDE.md or AGENT.md has the intend to make the use more structured.

All future .md files generated by the AI are now stored at `ai-docs` folder

### Usage

Add `CLAUDE-implementation-plan-chapter.md` to your `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT.md` or `copilot-instructions.md`. Easiest way is this :
- copy this repo to yours
- add the following lines to your agent-file:
```
## Implementation Plan Workflow

**IMPORTANT:** Read `CLAUDE-implementation-plan-chapter.md` for the XML-based implementation plan workflow. All feature requests, bugs, and changes must be tracked in `ai-docs/overview-features-bugs.xml`.
```

On first encounter with a codebase, perform the initial analysis with `/init_overview` and generate `ai-docs/overview.xml` and `ai-docs/overview-features-bugs.xml`.

After update CLAUDE.md and Commands you need to restart claude. Otherwise the changes show no effect.

### Slash Commands

There are several new /-Kommands enabled when adding this chapter to your AI-Behaviour:
If you are not using CLAUDE - like github-copilot you need to copy the prompts in `.claude/commands` for the same purpose.
If you are using copilot the `.github/prompts` has the same prompts as the claude-commands directory.

#### Item Creation

- `/bug <description>`: Create a bug item with default priority HIGH.
- `/feature <description>`: Create a feature item with default priority MEDIUM.
- `/refactor <description>`: Create a refactoring item with default priority MEDIUM.
- `/debt <description>`: Create a tech-debt item with default priority LOW.

#### Item Management

- `/approve <ID> [ID...]`: Approve items and generate branch names.
- `/implement [ID...]`: If a special ID is commited it's autoapproved, if none is commited - all Feature with APPROVED status will be implemented (max 5 in a row)
- `/deny <ID> [reason]`: Deny an item and archive it immediately.
- `/status <ID>`: Show current status, tasks, and dependencies.
- `/list [filter]`: List items by status, type, or priority.
- `/archive`: Archive eligible DONE/DENIED items and sync overview data.

#### Security

- `/security`: Run a full security audit of the codebase.
- `/security <area>`: Run a focused security audit (e.g. auth, api).
- `/security status`: Show open concerns and security coverage.

#### Plan Overview

- `/plan`: Show plan summary with next actionable items.
- `/overview`: Show architecture summary from overview.xml.
- `/init`: Run initial analysis and create both XML files.


### Features

- **Single source of truth**: Maintains active and archived work items in structured XML.
- **Clear lifecycle states**: Enforces `PENDING → APPROVED → IN_PROGRESS → DONE` or `DENIED`.
- **Consistent ID and branch rules**: Sequential IDs and standardized branch naming keep work traceable.
- **Built-in security evaluation**: Requires security impact assessment for relevant changes.
- **Complexity-aware planning**: Forces decomposition of XL items into manageable sub-items.
- **Audit-ready changelog**: Records each interaction's changes in a single entry.
- **Archival with project baseline sync**: Ensures completed work is reflected in `overview.xml`.
